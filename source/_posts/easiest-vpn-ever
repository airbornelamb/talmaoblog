Just came across an amazing solution for setting up a quick VPN. All you need is Python on the client and server side.

It's called sshuttle [](https://sshuttle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

1. Install with pip. `pip install sshuttle`
2. Connect via sshuttle to a remote machine on the network that you have access to `sshuttle -r user@remoteserver 10.1.10.0/24`
